            <p>
              Treachery is a project that I have started on to make a video
              game/interactive experience. This project is inspired by the board
              game betrayal at house on the hill made by Avalon Hill. I am
              working on the project as part of a group and our we are using
              github to track and manage our work. Our <a href="https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/treachery">project page </a>
              has more information on the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              The object of this experience it to manage a large project as a group
              and to learn how to make and design 3D models. This experience will
              be over this August but the project will always need more work
              to be done in order to finish the full game.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project was planned to last from April to August 2017. The project
              took the time span. The project was not able to be completed in
              the current time frame, although I was able to make an alpha version
              of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project is fully published to github and I have made posts on
              the <a href="https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/wip-treachery-horror-multiplayer-game.484787/">Unity Forums </a>

              The game is far from complete but does support a basic version of the
              game. Below is a screenshot from the game being played. In the picture
              players are simply exploring the house. In the game, players explore
              the house, and after a certain point the 'haunt' will start and
              one player will become the traitor. This traitor will attempt to
              kill the other 'heroes' while the heroes need to complete an
              objective to stop the traitor. There is simply a basic implementation
              of this completed in the project. I really enjoyed learning more about
              all the tools I used to create this and hope they will remain useful
              in the future.

            <h2> Game Explanation </h2>
            <p>
              1) Exploration - Players explore the house, find items and discover
              more information.
            </p>
            <p>
              2) Haunt - At some point in the game, something will trigger a haunt
              (finding an omen, discovering a secret, etc...) and one player will
              become the traitor and want to kill everyone else in a special scenario.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the board game, there are 50 unique haunts that vary from one
              traitor, free for all, cooperative, and mixed. As of right now we
              have only implemented one proof of concept haunt, the Ring Haunt:
              it starts when a player picks up the ring (any number of haunts is
              supported).

              The project had a vast scope and I really should have limited my
              original vision. My ambition and drive when working on the project
              were far beyond my actual ability. This passion helped push the
              project forward in the first month but as I ran out of time during
              the summer due to my job I faced major setbacks. In order to deal
              with this lack of energy, as a group, we started hosting the project
              on Github. This allowed us to remotely track our progress and sync
              our work as a group. The scope of the project was also decreased to
              just get an alpha version of the game working. These adaptations to
              challenge and adversity had somewhat crushed my original enthusiasm
              as the previous ideas no longer worked; I never enjoy admitting that
              I am wrong and need to change. Instead of spending my time designing
              and creating new applications I found myself more often than not
              debugging, writing reports and slowly progressing to the next
              objective. Progress was consistent but not what I had initially
              expected.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite not getting as much completed as I would have liked to, I
              developed my skills using the different software in addition to my
              skills of working in a group. I had previously hardly heard of Blender
              but after months of effort I learned how to make and animate a
              humanoid character. The character is used in the current version of
              the game and is one of the aspects my friends like most about the
              project; the character is definitely not a perfect but I can proudly
              look at the results from this and think that i have learned something.
              Additionally, I wouldn't have been able to make this character by
              myself. I had communicate and show progress reports to my friends.
              We worked together on the initial design and planning. I then took
              the results from this and made some initial attempts. At a later
              meeting I showed the results to the group, it was far from perfect
              but from these conversations I was able to continually improve the
              character. After about two months I had fully incorporated the
              character and it worked extremely well with the final project. In
              future group projects I hope to approach difficult challenges in this
              manner of using communication and conversations to improve the final
              project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the summer, when majority of the work was completed on the project,
              I also had a job doing research at Childrenâ€™s Hospital. This took
              away most of my free time and made it almost impossible to manage my
              time. I had to constantly make decisions about what to spend my time
              on. I defaulted to working at my job as this had more direct professional
              implications but still managed to report my progress to my group (even
              if it was very little) and continued to develop next steps and managed
              the current progress. One consistent point of difficult between me
              and my group was the level of dedication to the project. I have to
              accept that other people may not be as interested in the project and
              have to act toward them accordingly. I specifically remember giving
              different examples such as rendered images as opposed to gameplay
              segments when presenting progress to different group members. I also
              did this at my job when attempting to ask for help from different
              co-workers, like giving images and graphs to my boss when presenting
              progress and showing code snippets to my more tech savvy co workers.
              If I am able to be adaptive and willing to put in extra effort I will
              get better results when working in a group environment. This
              experience and my reflection will provide me with a greater perspective.
              In the future when I am working in any level of professional capacity I
              will better understand how to communicate and adapt myself to get the
              best results from working as a group.
